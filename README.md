
# ML Sports Project

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze and predict outcomes in sports. It aims to explore different predictive models using historical data, including but not limited to player performance, team statistics, and match results. The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable model that can predict the outcome of upcoming games, providing valuable insights to sports analysts, coaches, and fans.

## Features

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Importing and cleaning raw sports data from multiple sources.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, neural networks) to predict game outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing trends, player statistics, and predictions through charts and graphs.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A simple dashboard to explore the data, view predictions, and see performance metrics.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up the following environment:

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and experimenting with code in an interactive environment)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-sports-project.git
   cd ml-sports-project
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the project scripts to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions.

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare the raw data (`data_preprocessing.py`).
- **Model Training**: Scripts to train different ML models (`train_model.py`).
- **Prediction**: Use the trained models to make predictions (`predict.py`).
- **Visualization**: Visualize the results (`visualize.py`).

### Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the prediction script to predict the outcome of a match:

```bash
python predict.py --team1 "Team A" --team2 "Team B"
```

This will output the predicted result for the match between Team A and Team B.

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous outcomes such as scores.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied for binary outcomes (win/loss).
- **Random Forest Classifier**: For handling larger datasets and complex relationships.
- **Neural Networks**: For non-linear models with multiple hidden layers.

## Data Sources

This project utilizes several data sources, including:

- [Sports Data API](https://www.example.com/api) for match statistics.
- Historical match data from various sports leagues.
- Player performance data from open datasets (e.g., from Kaggle).
